# WIP Carry-over TODO — `wip/unrelated-wip-stash`

> **Status:** Closed · **Created:** 2026-07-01 · **Owner:** maintainer
> **Purpose:** Permanent record of work that lived only on the `wip/unrelated-wip-stash`
> preservation branch — what was adopted into `main`, what was explicitly declined, and
> why. The preservation branch was deleted after closeout; this file remains the audit trail.

## How this list was derived

`wip/unrelated-wip-stash` (commits `7fe2bd5` "ci: phase 0/1 devops transfer" and
`30aff49` "wip: preserved unrelated WIP from stash") branches from an **old base**
(`3a26623`, ~2026-06-29). Because of that stale base, a raw `git diff main..wip`
shows ~9,200 deletions — but those are **not real deletions**: they are files `main`
gained *after* the branch point (ADR-015/016, `Perfection-Roadmap.md`, the
`docs/runbooks/*`, `Supply-Chain-Grype-Policy.md`, `Graphify-Integration-Guide.md`,
the v1.3.0 release/version bumps, dependency upgrades, etc.). **None of those must be
re-deleted.**

Filtering to content that is genuinely *novel on wip and absent from `main`* leaves
only what is catalogued below.

## Resolution summary

### ✅ Adopted — landed on `main`

#### 1. Production-build smoke test  *(merged — PR #160 / CI `smoke:prod`)*

Adopted on `main`:

- `apps/web/scripts/smoke-prod-build.mjs`
- `apps/web/package.json` → `"smoke:prod": "node scripts/smoke-prod-build.mjs"`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → **"Smoke-test production build"** step after web build

No further action. This item is closed.

### ⛔ Declined — preserved for audit only

#### 2. `shared-types` compiled build output  *(DECLINED — 2026-07-01)*

wip switched `@nexus-hems/shared-types` from being consumed as raw TS source to a
compiled `dist/` (`tsconfig.build.json` emitting declarations + maps; `exports`
pointing at `./dist/index.js` + `./dist/index.d.ts`; `"files": ["dist"]`).

**Decision: declined.** `@nexus-hems/shared-types` is `private: true` + consumed via
`workspace:*` and is **never published to npm**, so nothing needs compiled output or
emitted `.d.ts` files. Both consumers read the TS source fine today — web via Vite,
api via `tsx`/Node — and each workspace type-checks against the strict root config.
Switching to `dist/` consumption would add a Turborepo build-ordering dependency
(shared-types must build before every web/api type-check + build), introduce
stale-`dist` failure modes, and break HMR on shared-types edits — real cost for zero
benefit on an internal-only package. The current source-consumption model stays.

For the record (so the now-deleted branch loses nothing), the exact file wip added:

```jsonc
// packages/shared-types/tsconfig.build.json (NOT adopted)
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "noEmit": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "src/**/*.test.ts"]
}
```

…plus `package.json` changes: `"files": ["dist"]`, `build` → `tsc -p
tsconfig.build.json`, and `exports."."` repointed from `./src/index.ts` to
`./dist/index.js` / `./dist/index.d.ts`. If a future need to publish shared-types
arises, revisit this with the build-ordering wiring in `turbo.json`.

## ⛔ DO NOT ADOPT — already in `main`, or stale/regressive on wip

These appear in the wip diff but must **not** be carried over:

- **Already landed in `main`** via this session's merged PRs (verified identical or
  superseded): `apps/api/src/config/trust-proxy.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/health.routes.ts`,
  `.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm/action.yml`, `apps/web/src/tests/command-safety.test.ts`,
  `apps/api/src/tests/health.routes.test.ts`, the CI v2 / coverage-ratchet work.
- **Stale safety regression — keep `main`:** `apps/api/src/protocols/index.ts` on wip
  removes the `isLiveHardwareAllowed` / `getEffectiveAdapterMode` /
  `logAdapterModeStartup` guards and defaults `ADAPTER_MODE` to **`live`**. `main`'s
  version (mock-default + `ALLOW_LIVE_HARDWARE` double-opt-in) is correct and must
  stand. Do not import wip's version.
- **Stale — keep `main`:** `apps/api/src/ws/energy.ws.ts` (wip predates main's
  `READ_ONLY_MODE` WS enforcement), `health.routes.ts` trivia, and all
  `package.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` dependency *down*grades from the old base.
- **Phantom deletions:** every `docs/**` / `helm/**` "removal" in `main..wip` is just
  the stale base lacking files `main` added later. Ignore entirely.

## Closing the branch — DONE (2026-07-01)

Item 1 (production smoke test) merged to `main` via PR 160; item 2 declined above
with its exact content preserved here. `wip/unrelated-wip-stash` (a **local-only**
branch, never pushed) therefore holds nothing unique and was deleted:

```bash
git branch -D wip/unrelated-wip-stash   # local-only; no remote ref existed
```

This file is the permanent record of what that branch contained and why each part
was adopted or declined.
